I'm a software engineer and life-long learner, passionate about building impactful solutions.

I began my journey developing software at a New Zealand-based global medical device company, helping deliver features that improved user training and patient care. Now at CSIRO, Australia's national science agency, I contribute to climate and agricultural data visualization tools for national and state-level initiatives, helping make data more accessible to both policymakers and the public.

I'm driven to apply my engineering skills for good, working to meaningfully improve people's lives. In my spare time, I enjoy exploring new technologies, reading, and making voxel art.
